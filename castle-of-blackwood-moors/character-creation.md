# Creating a character

## First play

I choose to go with the "skill" *Healthy* which seems to give you a Wolverine-like rate of wound recovery based on each entry that does not involve combat. Hopefully this is a kind of easy-mode.

I did then roll a lot of bandages as my starting gear, maybe I'll need them but it feels like this might be a wasted roll.

To take advantage of the ability I have wandered around locations to tick up my health. There seems to be no disadvantage to "walking it off" but interestingly there are a few entries that cause and injury when you are investigating locations.
