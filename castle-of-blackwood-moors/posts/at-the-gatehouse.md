# At the gatehouse

There is an ever present sense of being watched at the ruined gatehouse and some tempting vines that offer a way to climb over the walls. Mindful of the other adventurer's gruesome death though I hug the dirt and make it past the portcullis with nothing more than a feeling of paranoia.
