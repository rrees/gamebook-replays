# To Adventure!

With a spare set of rations as a gift I head out towards the castle. I see a dark shape on the road ahead and decide to investigate. It turns out to be the horribly broken and decayed body of one of the adventurers who passed through the village recently. It looks like he fell from a great height.

I pocket a silver cloak clasp I find nearby but the encounter has shaken me up a bit.
