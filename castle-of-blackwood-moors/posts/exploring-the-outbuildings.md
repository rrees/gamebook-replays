# Exploring the castle buildings

Having successfully navigated my first life or death battle I take some time to explore the nearby buildings, ideally I want to find some better gear that I might be able to use.

A collapsed building, almost a mound, seems to contain a corpse surrounded by fungus. This seems highly dangerous. A shop with a candle sign turns out to contain waxy humanoid figures that seem highly dangerous.

I find a hidden courtyard and it turns out there might be even more buildings outside the main keep but I'm starting to lose track of where everything is. The battle that wrecked the keep is still much in evidence but it seems like the attackers were pretty thorough in picking everything over and none of the other adventurers seem to have died here.

I find an archery range but most of the equipment is broken, then I get my first break. A quiver with some intact arrows in it. I don't have a bow but in bowyer's shop there was a trap that used arrows of the same size as ammunition. Maybe I can use the two to try and bring down some kind of larger monster.
