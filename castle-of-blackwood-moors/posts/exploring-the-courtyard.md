# Exploring the courtyard

There are actually quite a few different buildings here. I decide to take advantage of the fog and explore a nearby courtyard, this has a well in it that looks like an ominous one-way exploration. It looks like you can enter the castle properly from here but that seems a bit premature.

Instead I decide to go back and explore the outbuildings a bit more.
