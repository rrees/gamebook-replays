# Spider attack

One of the buildings has a constant banging noise in it, if that's something trapped it sounds dangerous. The collapsed mound has fungi fruiting in it, that also seems dangerous. The archery butt seems a safer place to scavenge for any usable equipment as all I have to defend myself currently is the quarterstaff.

Despite the detritus of battle all around it seems that everything left has either been picked over a long time ago or is damaged beyond use.

Next to the archery range is what seems to be a bowyers. Again it seems to be picked clean. The stairs to the upper floor seem ominous but while investigating the work benches I discover that it is actually eight eyes hiding in the ceiling that were creating the feeling of being watched.

The spider is large but more dog-sized and while we trade blows I'm able to get the better of it and smash it to death. I should be able to just walk off my injuries but this shows that I need to try and get some protection before I get into any serious trouble. A workable shield at the very least.
