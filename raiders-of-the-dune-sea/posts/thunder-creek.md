# Thunder Creek

The first quest hub is the town of Thunder Creek. Tonally this is a complete shift in the book for me, we started out with medieval style troubadors, then I had the impression of Arabian style sandstorms and coast lines. Thunder Creek though is a straight-up Western cliche town with an air wizard twist.

The aeronauts are intriguing and the idea that a society has excess magicians who end crafting petty magic if they can't provide the propulsive power to sand skiffs is also pretty interesting.

But the literal cowboy tropes like a saloon really breaks both my immersion in the story and my sense of what kind of story this is.
