# First Quest: Death by insect

So Green quests are meant to be easily completed. Tell that to the giant scorpion (followed by a giant spider on a replay) who killed me. My character was effectively just a damage sponge as my companion steadily whittled down the enemy's health.

Both creatures interestingly reduce your Speed and therefore it was really in Brawn and Armour that I was failing. Not able to dish out a meaningful amount of damage even when I did score a hit.

The dice rolling for the combat was also less than satisfying. I think I might have to automate that.

I also encountered the former comrade who had turned bandit. Stabbed in the stomach in the abandoned farmhouse. Seems a bit of a conincidence so I suspect this will tie back into the betrayal of Sanha.
