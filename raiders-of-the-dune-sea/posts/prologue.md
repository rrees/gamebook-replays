# Prologue

There is quite a long short story at the start of the book that flashbacks to your character's childhood.

There's clearly some time schenanigans going on here. The persecution for a future crime, the use of the name Chronus and the Timekeeper ring. It's not too subtle.

I wasn't expecting a betrayal though! You have the opportunity to interact with both the NPCs which helps invest a bit of interest with them. Then you lose both of them with an unspoken dispute between them.

I imagine the traitor will turn up in future with some notionally reasonable explanation of their behaviour.
