# Bribery

After climbing off the beach and burying my father figure I cross back over the mountains that we just travelled through to get here. On the way here I paid off a bunch of bandits who were charging a toll and on the way back I find out my adoptive mother sold my horse to a drunkard so once again I'm paying people to avoid trouble.

I'm assuming money is pretty easy come easy go but who knows. I'm down to five silver now but with the acquisition of my horse we are now into the realm of the quest hub which is what I associate the Destiny Quest series with.

The whole introduction has been more exposition and reading than actual playing and it wasn't really good enough to emotionally connect me to the story that was being told. Let's see how the more conventional part of the book plays out.
