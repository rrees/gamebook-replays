# First combat

This fight is against a shaman who can potentially regenerate each round (a little hard to remember to do correctly). The dice rolling feels like it goes on longer than is enjoyable but it is a near to the knuckle thing, even with the shaman never successfully healing themselves.

At the end you return your health to full, which is much more like a computer game than most gamebooks.
