# Raiders of the Dune Sea

There's clearly some time schenanigans going on her. The persecution for a future crime, the use of the name Chronus and the Timekeeper ring. It's not too subtle.

I wasn't expecting a betrayal though! You have the opportunity to interact with both the NPCs which helps invest a bit of interest with them. Then you lose both of them with an unspoken dispute between them.

I imagine the traitor will turn up in future with some notionally reasonable explanation of their behaviour.

## The Beach

Apparantly my character can heal from injuries that can be almost fatal, which I guess fits in with the "respawn when dead" aspect of the books.

Creatures are arguing over some junk on the beach, there's a nice option to just wait for them to be frustrated with not being able to open a box they've found rather than just killing them.
